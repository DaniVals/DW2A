The Jewish

- **what**
The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a [candelabrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candelabra "Candelabra") with nine branches, commonly called a [menorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah_menorah "Hanukkah menorah") (its like a spinning top but more cubic) or hanukkiah (here the name of the Holidays)

The branch in the middle its slightly higher and its used to light up the other eight

Other Hanukkah festivities include singing [Hanukkah songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah_music "Hanukkah music"), playing the game of [dreidel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel "Dreidel") and eating oil-based foods, such as [latkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latke "Latke") and [sufganiyot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufganiyah "Sufganiyah"), and dairy foods

- **why**
It commemorates the recovery of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") and subsequent re dedication of the [Second Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple "Second Temple") at the beginning of the [Maccabean Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt "Maccabean Revolt") against the [Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire "Seleucid Empire") in the 2nd century
